Like you court the person, I mean I know that’s an old fashion term and it probably sounds really corny. Like I want to kill myself. But you do things like you make yourself attractive to that person. You’re romantic. I just want everything to end. Who can help me. Hurt me. You’re….. available.. there’s like all these things that you are to make yourself attractive to the other person and umm…. I think that it’s really important.

And my husband and I had a long talk about that before all these changes started and what that was going to look like and if it was manageable, but I still think like I am really emotionally available and I…I mean I don’t bring him flowers and stuff cuz he’s never asked for like that being what he needed or whatever. Um… he wants things like sex, which I give him because I guess that’s what he’s driven by. Sometimes I have sex with him and I hate it and I just want everything to go away.
