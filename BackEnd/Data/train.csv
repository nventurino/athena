Noise,We purged every nook and cranny in the house of unused useful treasures.

Noise,He bought it at Walmart
Noise,"Dad hadn’t been a bad guy, as far as I remember."
Noise,"It was just that, between the checked boxes of fatherhood, absence was his only constant."
Noise,I’ve made thinking about him an art form.
Noise,I’ve had plenty of time to practice and perfect my craft in the years we’ve been together
Noise,I don’t know how much of this first memory is my own recollection.
Noise,"I wrote and rewrote a text,"
Noise,"Sorry bud, I think you got the wrong number."

Noise,"So every trip home, I compose a little speech."
